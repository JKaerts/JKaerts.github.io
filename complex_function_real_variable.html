<h3 class="topic">Complex functions of a real variable</h3>
<p>
Just like a real function of a real variable, we can consider complex functions of a real variable.
These are functions of the form
\[f\colon I \subseteq \R \to \C \colon t \mapsto f(t).\]
Let's call these functions CRV-functions (Complex functions of a Real Variable).
</p>
<p>
Why are we looking at these functions? Because we can look at differential equations of CRV-functions.
</p>
<p>
We consider such a function \(f\) to be <em>differentiable</em> at a point \(t\) if the limit
\[\lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(t+h) - f(t)}{h}\]
exists in \(\C\).
This limit is then denoted by \(f'(t)\).
</p>
<p>
The shape of this limit, the difference quotient, is exactly the same as for real functions of a real variable.
Do we need to develop an entirely new theory of differentiation for CRV functions? Not if we're clever about it.
Every complex number has a real part and an imaginary part.
Because \(f(t)\) is a complex number we can find two real numbers \(u(t)\) and \(v(t)\) such that
\[f(t) = u(t) + iv(t)\]
This means that there are two real functions of a real variable (\(u\) and \(v\)) such that \(f = u+iv\).
</p>
<p>
Using this notation we can see that (if everything works out nicely)
\[\begin{align*}
f'(t) &amp;= \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{f(t+h)-f(t)}{h}\\
      &amp;= \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{u(t+h)-u(t)}{h} + i\frac{v(t+h)-v(t)}{h}\\
      &amp;= u'(t) + iv'(t)
\end{align*}\]
The function \(f\) is therefore differentiable (in the CRV sense) if both \(u\) and \(v\) are (in the ordinary sense) and there is a simple relationship between their derivatives.
</p>
<p>
In general we can state that
\[\begin{align*}
f(t) &amp;= u(t)+iv(t)\\
f'(t) &amp;= u'(t) + iv'(t)\\
f''(t) &amp;= u''(t) + iv''(t)\\
f^{(3)}(t) &amp;= u^{(3)}(t) + iv^{(3)}(t)\\
\end{align*}\]
and so on.
</p>
<p>
Now we can look at differential equations of CRV-functions.
Because we have given meaning to the concept of the derivative of a CRV-function, it makes sense to ask if there exists a CRV-function \(f\) such that
\[f'' + f = 0.\]
Again, like in the real case we can look for exponential solutions to this equation.
We try to find \(r\in\C\) such that \(t\mapsto e^{rt}\) is a solution to the equation.
In that case \(r\) has to satisfy --- like in the real case --- the characteristic equation
\(r^2 + 1 = 0\)
so \(r\) is equal to \(i\) or \(-i\).
The general solution to the differential equation is therefore
\[f(t) = Ae^{it} + Be^{-it}\]
for two constants \(A\) and \(B\).
